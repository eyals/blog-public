14:T706,<h1>Why It Makes Total Sense for Apple to Make a TV</h1>
<p>![](./Why It Makes Total Sense for Apple to Make a TV _ by Eyal Shahar _ Medium_files/1_UfW0mioTT2PG6UQ0tlyMug.jpg)</p>
<p>I am not the guy who tries predicting the future just to say “I told you so”, but the idea of Apple selling their own TV sets strikes me as a logical move in many ways, that I can’t understand how come it’s not happening.</p>
<h2>First, What’s wrong with the external Apple TV?</h2>
<p>![](./Why It Makes Total Sense for Apple to Make a TV _ by Eyal Shahar _ Medium_files/1_W3Crweu0Ixd6txv4jp182Q.jpg)</p>
<p>I owned Apple TV since it’s first generation. I understand why Apple chose to create a cheap device that connects to any TV instead of selling the TV itself, but I believe that <strong>external devices just don’t work</strong>. There are two reasons why:</p>
<p>1 — When most people consume TV content through a cable provider, that’s their default. When they want to watch something — they just turn the TV on, and zap through channels.</p>
<p>2 — Nobody loves a second remote. The first one is already one too many, with its gazillion buttons that nobody uses, but you have no choice but to use it. Once in a while, when you want to use that secondary one, you need to go through the ceremony of looking through the drawers and under the sofa cushions. Especially if it’s the Apple TV remote, that recently changed from ‘tiny’ to ‘very small’.</p>
<p>3 — Buying an external device is a separate decision than buying a TV. So the consumer needs to decide that he wants to invest in it. If Apple were to sell TV sets, that would just be another (probably lucrative) option to choose from. Many would even choose Apple without understanding why it’s better for them.</p>
