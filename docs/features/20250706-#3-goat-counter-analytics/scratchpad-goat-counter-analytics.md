# Scratchpad - GoatCounter Analytics

## Development Log

- 🏁 **TASK STARTED**: GoatCounter analytics integration
- 📣 **INSTRUCTION**: Add GoatCounter script to blog pages with URL https://eyalblog.goatcounter.com/count
- 📝 **NOTE**: Script should be: `<script data-goatcounter="https://eyalblog.goatcounter.com/count" async src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script>`
- 📝 **NOTE**: Need to analyze current site structure to determine integration points
- 🔍 **ANALYSIS**: Found Next.js App Router structure with root layout at `src/app/layout.tsx`
- 📝 **NOTE**: Layout has `<head>` section with fonts and meta tags - perfect place for GoatCounter script
- ☝️ **DECISION**: Will add GoatCounter script to the `<head>` section in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- ✅ **TASK COMPLETED**: Added GoatCounter script to layout.tsx at line 46
- 📝 **NOTE**: Initially tried regular `<script>` tag in `<head>` but didn't work with Next.js App Router
- ☝️ **DECISION**: Switched to Next.js `Script` component with `afterInteractive` strategy
- 🧪 **TESTING**: Verified script loads on homepage (http://localhost:3000)
- 🧪 **TESTING**: Verified script loads on post page (http://localhost:3000/acoustic-guitar-maintenance)
- ✅ **TASK COMPLETED**: GoatCounter analytics successfully integrated and tested
